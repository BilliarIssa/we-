*/So again, Let's dive into SQL query, so we have two tables: first one is the information about suppliers,
the second one is their location. So i need to combine these two tables and make and query 
that will ouput combinde table. Then create new table with name "SORTED": /*

SELECT DISTINCT
r.name_company,
r.passport_id,
r.quantity,
r1.Status
INTO SORTED
FROM
rams r
JOIN
rams1 r1 ON r1.Track_ID = r.City_id;

/*Also, I did not like the phone_number formats;
like: 77711234567, It is not comfortable to read.
*/
UPDATE rams
SET phone_number = '7 (' + SUBSTRING(CAST(phone_number AS VARCHAR), 2, 3) + ') ' +
SUBSTRING(CAST(phone_number AS VARCHAR), 5, 3) + ' ' +
SUBSTRING(CAST(phone_number AS VARCHAR), 8, 2) + ' ' +
SUBSTRING(CAST(phone_number AS VARCHAR), 10, 2);

UPDATE RAMS
SET date = LEFT(date, 10);

/*IT WILL SELECT IN DATE column only first ten characters;*/

update rams
SET date = REPLACE(date, '.', '/');

select
DateName (year, date) + '-' + DateName(month, date) + '-' + DATENAME(DAY, date) AS date_sup,
COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS total_orders
INTO day_order
FROM rams
GROUP BY
DateName(YEAR, date) + '-' + DateName(MONTH, date) + '-' + DateName(DAY, date);

select *from rams

select date, sum(quantity) as qnt, (select sum(quantity) from rams) as total, CAST(sum(quantity) * 100 /
(select sum(quantity) from rams) as decimal(10,2)) as PRCNT

from rams
group by date
order by prcnt asc;
